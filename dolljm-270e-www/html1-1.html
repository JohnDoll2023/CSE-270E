            My name is John Doll and I'm a senior studying computer science at Miami University. I am from Wapakoneta, Ohio and will be moving to Boynton Beach, Florida after I
            graduate in May. I will be doing iOS mobile application development for a lighting company called Lutron. I am very excited to move south to enjoy warmer weather and 
            spend some time on the beach. I am also excited to start my career and begin my life as an adult. I am looking forward to the next chapter of my life.

                    <li>I made this website so obviously I am fond of it. I spent a lot of time creating it sophomore year. It needs updated, I'll get to that later.</li>

                    <li>Bannerweb is one of my favorite websites because it lets me register and unregister for courses. It also lets me check my graudation progress.</li>
